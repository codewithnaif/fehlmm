    "#### The difference betweeen Interpreted vs Compiled Languages\n",
    "* Compiled: Translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++) → Faster execution.\n",
    "* Interpreted: Executed line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript) → Easier debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "It allows the program to deal with runtime errors gracefully without crashing using try, except, finally, and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of finally Block\n",
    "The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically used to clean up resources like closing a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging in Python\n",
    "A way to track events during execution using the logging module — helpful for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance of __del__ Method\n",
    "A destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed — used for cleanup (e.g., closing database connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the difference between import vs from ... import\n",
    "    import module: Imports the whole module.\n",
    "    from module import function: Imports only specific functions/classes from a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code\n",
    "except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or handle differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code\n",
    "except TypeError:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of with Statement in File Handling\n",
    "Automatically manages file opening and closing, even if exceptions occur.\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    data = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multithreading vs Multiprocessing\n",
    "    Multithreading: Multiple threads share the same memory space (good for I/O-bound tasks).\n",
    "    Multiprocessing: Multiple processes with separate memory (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Using Logging\n",
    "    Tracks events\n",
    "    Easier debugging\n",
    "    Provides different levels (info, warning, error, etc.)\n",
    "    Stores logs in files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Management in Python\n",
    "Automatic memory management using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in Exception Handling\n",
    "    Use try to wrap code\n",
    "    Catch errors with except\n",
    "    Use else if no error occurs\n",
    "    Use finally to clean up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Memory Management is Important\n",
    "It avoids memory leaks and keeps applications efficient and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role of try and except\n",
    "try: Contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "except: Handles the exception, preventing crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's Garbage Collection\n",
    "Uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free unused memory automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of else in Exception Handling\n",
    "Executes code only if no exception was raised in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Logging Levels\n",
    "    DEBUG\n",
    "    INFO\n",
    "    WARNING\n",
    "    ERROR\n",
    "    CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### os.fork() vs multiprocessing\n",
    "    os.fork(): Unix-specific, creates child processes at OS level.\n",
    "    multiprocessing: Cross-platform, higher-level abstraction using Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Closing Files\n",
    "Frees system resources and prevents data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### file.read() vs file.readline()\n",
    "    read(): Reads the entire file.\n",
    "    readline(): Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### logging Module Use\n",
    "Provides a standard way to log messages with different severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### os Module in File Handling\n",
    "Used for file/directory operations like creating, renaming, deleting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Management Challenges\n",
    "    Circular references\n",
    "    Memory leaks in long-running apps\n",
    "    Manual memory control is limited\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raising Exceptions Manually\n",
    "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "Improves performance in I/O-bound programs like web scraping, file I/O, or GUI responsiveness.\n"
